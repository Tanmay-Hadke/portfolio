# Research Contribution
[Applications of Quantum Dots](https://www.ijset.in/wp-content/uploads/IJSET_V12_issue3_576.pdf)
- **Abstract:** Quantum dots are also called fluorescent nanocrystals that play an important role in biological and bio-medical fields. They are well-known for their drug-delivering capabilities and cellular imaging.In electronics perspective, quantum dots act as semiconductor nanoparticles that exhibit unique optical properties such as size-controlled fluorescence that is being used in quantum dot televisions, high quantum yields, and stability against photobleaching. Carbon being a very important element in chemistry has an important role in the applications of quantum dots as well. Graphene, a carbon compound, is introduced with the concept of Graphene Quantum Dot or GQD.
